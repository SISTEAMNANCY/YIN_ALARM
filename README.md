Count the number of semitones between the notes of a medical critical alarm melody  (CEI 601.1.8)

Why? Because the manufacturer is authorized to transpose the melodic scheme with a C3 between 150 and 500Hz.

From our article "Intelligibilité des alarmes critiques au bloc opératoire" - 30/05/25 Doi : 10.1016/j.irbmnw.2025.100616

Yin libary is adapted from JorenSix/Pidato  https://github.com/JorenSix/Pidato

Ok to use with an ESP32 S3 and an I2S microphone (INMP441)

Tested in RX and TX with Heltec lora 32 v3, you will need to adapt your parameters for your own project (I2S and Yin analyse like buffer, threshold..)
